### 2.0.0
 - Aggregated all Swig related packages under one repository.
 - Implemented Lerna based structure and workflow. 

### 1.3.0
- Improvement:
  - Removed call to `harmonize` module for Node 6 and above.
    The use of this module was creating an issue with `yarn` based installations.
  - We can now safely use `yarn`! üçæ


### 1.2.0
- Improvement:
  - Better `node` version check.
  - Made `node` v6 the minimum version required.

### 1.1.0
- Improvement:
  - Made swig tasks overridable via locally installed dependencies


### 1.0.0
- Breaking Changes:
  - The reworked `swig assets-deploy` will now produce JS artifacts inside the
    `public/js/<app-name>/app` folder. The bundler will fetch from that folder
    and will continue to create merged/minified assets in `public/js/<app-name>`
    Applications that were defining their dependencies by prefixing their id
    with `src.` must now change it to `app.` or start using ES6 modules instead.

- Improvements:
  - Introduced new `swig transpile-scripts` task, used to transform ES6 and
    React JSX code to ES5 code.
  - Added new watcher to the run task to automatically transpile scripts:
    `swig run --watch-scripts`. You can also call it standalone with
    `swig watch-scripts`.
