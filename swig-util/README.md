# gilt-swig-util

Contains utility modules for swig.

## Publishing

When publishing an update to these modules, you must also bump
the patch version on [swig proper](https://github.com/gilt/gilt-swig) and
publish swig. This ensures that users will be notified of an update to swig
and/or one of it's dependencies, and update before performing tasks.

### swig-util

Documentation forthcoming


### swig-log

Swig-log provides logging mechanisms to swig modules. The `log` object
is appended onto the swig-wide `swig` shared object.

Properties:

  - log.symbols
    This object is initally populated with unicode symbols from the npm module
     `log-symbols`. If --pretty=false is used, the unicode symbols are replaced
     with ascii representations.
    Available properties:
    - symbols.info
    - symbols.warning
    - symbols.error
    - symbols.success
    - symbols.connector
    - symbols.start

  - log.padding
    The default line padding used by the main function.

Methods:

  - log(what)
    Sends data to the terminal. eg. console.log.

  - log.confirm(question)
    Sends a question to the terminal and waits for user input. Returns the
    user's response.

  - log.error(prefix, what)
    Sends an 'error' line to the terminal.
    The line is prefixed with the error symbol, optional prefix text, and the
    data specified.

    Sends an 'info' line to the terminal.
    The line is prefixed with the info symbol, optional prefix text, and the

    data specified.
