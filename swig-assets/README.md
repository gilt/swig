# gilt-swig-assets
Swig tasks that are associated with Gilt's asset pipeline.

## Publishing

When publishing an update to one of these task modules, you must also bump
the patch version on [swig proper](https://github.com/gilt/gilt-swig) and
publish swig. This ensures that users will be notified of an update to swig
and/or one of it's dependencies, and update before performing tasks.
